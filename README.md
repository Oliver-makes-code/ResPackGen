# ResPackGen
A tool for the creation and management of Resource and Data Packs for Minecraft: Java Edition

## This tool uses [FennecConfig](https://github.com/Oliver-makes-code/FennecConfig)

FennecConfig is a config language designed around readability and user friendliness.

During the `build` task, it transpiles all fennec files to JSON, in order for Minecraft to load them.

You can also create JSON files instead, and it will work fine with this.
